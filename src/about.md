I capture images of the things that interest me most. That's why you'll see pictures from nature and of people, pets, and vacations here.

My primary photo gear is Olympus: OM-1 camera and the excellent 12-40mm f/2.8 II PRO, 40-150mm f/2.8 PRO, and the 300mm f4.0 IS PRO. At home, I print the best of my images with an Epson SureColor P800.
